The code for the paper: [Improved GUI Grounding via Iterative Narrowing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13591)

## Abstract

Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding plays a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents. While general VLMs, such as GPT-4V, demonstrate strong performance across various tasks, their proficiency in GUI grounding remains suboptimal. Recent studies have focused on fine-tuning these models specifically for zero-shot GUI grounding, yielding significant improvements over baseline performance. We introduce a visual prompting framework that employs an iterative narrowing mechanism to improve the performance of both general and fine-tuned models. In the case of general models, we observed improvements by up to 61%. For evaluation, we tested our method on a comprehensive benchmark comprising various UI platforms and provided the code to reproduce our results.
